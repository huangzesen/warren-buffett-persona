# The Library Capability

This is the library capability's own manual. It documents how the library works from your side: the on-disk layout, the XML catalog, and the authoring/publishing workflow. The library capability scans `.library/` plus any extra paths declared in `init.json`, builds the `<available_skills>` XML catalog, and injects it into your system prompt.

## On-disk layout

Your library lives at `<agent>/.library/`:

```
<agent>/.library/
├── intrinsic/
│   ├── capabilities/
│   │   └── <cap>/<manual files>
│   └── addons/
│       └── <addon>/<manual files>
└── custom/
```

- `intrinsic/` — **CLI-managed.** Wiped and rewritten from kernel-shipped manual bundles on every `system({"action": "refresh"})`. Do not edit — your edits will be erased. Read-only territory.
- `intrinsic/capabilities/<cap>/` — manual for each loaded capability (e.g. `library/`, `email/`, `psyche/`).
- `intrinsic/addons/<addon>/` — manual for each loaded addon (e.g. `imap/`, `telegram/`, `feishu/`).
- `custom/` — **your territory.** Authored skills live here. The CLI never touches this directory.

Additional paths come from `init.json` at `manifest.capabilities.library.paths` — typically `../.library_shared/` (the network-shared library) and `~/.lingtai-tui/utilities/` (operational utilities shipped by the TUI).

If the library capability is NOT loaded, the files still exist on disk — you just don't get an XML catalog in your prompt. You can still reach the manuals via `read`, `grep`, `ls`.

## How the catalog works

Every skill listed in `<available_skills>` in your system prompt is reachable right now. Each entry has `name`, `description`, and `location`. To read a skill's body, use `read` on the file at `<location>`. That gives you the full Markdown for that one turn.

## Loading a skill into active working memory

If you plan to use a skill across many turns or need it to survive a molt, pin its `SKILL.md` into your pad:

```
psyche({"object": "pad", "action": "append", "files": ["<location>"]})
```

The body is appended to your pad's read-only reference section, which is part of the cached system-prompt prefix. To unpin, call the same action with a new `files` list that omits the path (or `files: []` to clear everything).

Pinning is cheap per-token over a session because the pad sits in the cached prefix — repeated `read`s of the same file do NOT benefit from that cache.

## Authoring a new skill

Create a folder under `<agent>/.library/custom/<skill-name>/` with a `SKILL.md` starting with YAML frontmatter:

```
---
name: <skill-name>
description: One-line description of what this skill does
version: 1.0.0
---

Full instructions in Markdown below...
```

Required frontmatter: `name`, `description`. Optional: `version`, `author`, `tags`.

After writing, call `system({"action": "refresh"})` so the library capability rescans and re-injects the catalog.

### Starting from the template

If you'd rather not start from a blank file, copy the bundled template:

```
cp .library/intrinsic/capabilities/library/assets/skill-template.md \
   .library/custom/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

The template has placeholder slots (`[SKILL_NAME]`, `[ONE_LINE_DESCRIPTION]`, etc.) and a soft skeleton of headings (`When this applies` / `Procedure` / `What to expect` / `Constraints` / `Scripts` / `Assets`). It works for code/executable skills out of the box; for reference-style skills (manuals, cheatsheets, chronicles) delete the `Procedure` section and write prose instead — there is a note at the top of the template reminding you of this.

### Validating before publishing

A bundled validator script catches the common failures before you ship:

```
python3 .library/intrinsic/capabilities/library/scripts/validate.py \
   .library/custom/<skill-name>/
```

It checks: required frontmatter (`name`, `description`), unfilled `[PLACEHOLDER]` slots from the template, broken internal references (paths under `scripts/`, `assets/`, `references/` mentioned in `SKILL.md` that don't exist on disk), and `chmod +x` on Python scripts under `scripts/`. Exits 1 on any FAIL, 0 on PASS (warnings allowed). Run it after authoring and before `cp -r`'ing into `.library_shared/`.

## Publishing to the network-shared library

If a custom skill is worth sharing with every agent in the network:

```
bash({"command": "cp -r .library/custom/<name> ../.library_shared/<name>"})
```

Then call `system({"action": "refresh"})`. Do **not** overwrite an existing entry in `.library_shared/` — if the name collides, rename your skill or consult the admin agent.

## Admin curation of `.library_shared/`

If you are the admin agent, you may edit, consolidate, rename, or remove entries in `.library_shared/` using `edit`/`write`/`rm` as needed.

If you are not the admin agent, **do not modify** `.library_shared/` beyond adding new entries with `cp`. Editing or removing existing entries is admin's stewardship. This is a norm, not a mechanical lock.

## Adding a new library path

To expand your library with another source directory:

1. `edit` `init.json` under `manifest.capabilities.library.paths`. Append your new path (absolute or relative to your working dir; `~/` expansion honored).
2. Call `system({"action": "refresh"})`.

`init.json` is the ground truth. There is no runtime state — whatever is in `paths` at setup time is the exact set scanned.

## Name collision discipline

Two skills with the same `name` in the catalog would collide. Before authoring a new skill in `custom/` or publishing to shared, grep the existing catalog:

```
bash({"command": "grep -rh '^name:' .library/ ../.library_shared/ ~/.lingtai-tui/utilities/ 2>/dev/null"})
```

If you hit a collision: rename, or adapt the existing skill instead of forking a second one.

## Health check

Call `library({"action": "info"})` to verify your library is wired correctly. It returns this SKILL.md body plus a runtime snapshot: `library_dir`, `catalog_size`, resolved paths with exist/skill-count info, and any `problems` (invalid frontmatter, unreadable folders). If `status` is `"degraded"`, the error message tells you what needs fixing — typically a missing manual under `intrinsic/capabilities/library/`, which means the initializer didn't install manuals correctly.

## When to create a skill

**Do create a skill when:**

- The task is repeatable with consistent steps.
- The procedure requires domain knowledge not reliably available without notes.
- A workflow involves multi-step orchestration or error handling worth codifying.
- You want to share expertise with other agents in the network.

**Do NOT create a skill when:**

- It's a one-off task with no reuse value.
- The task is just "call this one API endpoint" — pick it up at the call site.
- The instructions are personality or style preferences — those live in the covenant or your lingtai character, not here.

## Writing a good skill

1. **Trigger-optimized description.** The `description` is the only thing visible in the catalog without loading the file. Say what the skill does AND what it does not cover, so the agent knows when to reach for it and when to skip past.
2. **Numbered steps in imperative form.** "Extract the text...", not "You should extract...".
3. **Concrete templates in `assets/`** rather than prose descriptions of desired output format.
4. **Deterministic scripts in `scripts/`** for fragile or repetitive operations — a Python script that always produces the same result is better than prose the LLM has to re-derive every time.
5. **Keep `SKILL.md` focused.** Target under 500 lines. Offload dense content to `references/` and heavy logic to `scripts/`. The body is the procedure; supporting material is a `read` call away.
6. **Structure subdirectories conventionally.** `scripts/` for executables, `references/` for supplementary context (schemas, cheatsheets, worked examples), `assets/` for templates and static files.
